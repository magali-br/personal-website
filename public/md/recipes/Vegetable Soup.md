My dad makes the most delicious soups by tossing together a random set of vegetables into the pressure cooker and all sorts of bits and pieces. When my mom visited this June, we tried our hand at our own version, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that thanks to the 7 onions we threw in, it was nearly as flavourful as my dad's.

### Ingredients:

- 3-7 onions
- 2 cloves of garlic
- Vegetables: red peppers, potatoes, carrots, a couple of tomatoes, ...
  - More original: fennel, rutabaga, turnip, spinach, tomatoes...
  - You can even throw in some lettuce.
- (optional) Meat bones or vegetable broth
  - If you have some leftover bones, toss them in for extra flavour.
  - Also add vegetable cooking water if you have any.
- 2 laurel leaves
- fresh herbs (oregano, thyme, whatever you have lying around) or dried herbe de provence

### Steps:

1. Heat some oil and fry the onions.
1. Add all the vegetables and enough water to cover them up completely.
1. Bring to a boil and simmer for a couple of hours.
