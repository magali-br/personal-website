This is an incredibly delicious dish, and when we first learned to make it, we were shocked to realize that it doesn’t contain any spices.

### Ingredients

- 1kg of onions (you can use fewer but the more onions you use, the more delicious it will be)
- 1 cup of brown lentils
- 1/2 cup of round white rice (we’ve used basmati and brown rice to success)
- olive oil
- salt

### Instructions

1. Cut the onions into slices and fry them in a frying pan in a lot of oil, on medium-low heat, stirring almost constantly, until the onions are fully caramelized and brown.

- This takes a long time; don’t rush and be patient, the result will be worth it!
- It’s okay if some small parts turn black, but you don’t want to burn them.
- To save time, you can buy pre-fried onions, like those from Ikea or TRS (which you might find in a Chinese or Turkish supermarket).

1. Boil the lentils in 3-4 times the amount of water, until they are cooked but firm.
1. Boil the rice, with salt, separately.
1. Drain the lentils (I like to reserve the juice to drink as a broth or put in a soup).
1. Mix the rice, lentils, and half of the onions in a saucepan. The easiest way to avoid shredding the lentils is to use a layering technique: add some rice to the bottom, add the lentils on top, fried onions, and repeat.
1. Season with salt and olive oil, and cover with the rest of the fried onions.
