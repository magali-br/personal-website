### Ingredients:
* 4 eggs 
* 400g of sugar (brown cane sugar works well too, brown sugar possible but not as good maybe?)
* 1 1/4 cup of oil (1 1/8 cup also works if want to reduce fat)
* 250g of flour
* 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 6 turns of ground pepper
* ½ tsp ground ginger 
* ¼ tsp cloves
* 2 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp salt
* 850mL of very densely packed grated carrots (about 4 large ones, 400g-450g)
* 1 tsp vanilla (optional)

### Steps:
1. Beat eggs with sugar.
1. Slowly add oil, beat well in between.

1. Beating with a hand mixer definitely makes everything fluffier.
1. Add carrots  and vanilla (if desired - not necessary)
1. Bake at convection 170 C with baking sheets above and below, don't cover, bake 45-55 minutes. (At 35-40 min, often have to cover and remove convection
