Ingredients:
* 500mL whipping cream
* 250g dark chocolate (50-65% cocoa)
* 1/4 tsp salt

Steps:
1. Heat up the whipping cream and salt - don't let it boil.
1. Add the chocolate and let melt. Stir until well mixed.
1. Slow version: Place overnight in the fridge. Fast version: Place in freezer for 1 hour. (If you forget it, you'll just have to let it thaw in the fridge. It should be as cold as possible, but not frozen, when you whip it.)
1. Whip with a mixer. It should solidify into mousse consistency instantly.
