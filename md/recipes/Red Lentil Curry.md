###Ingredients:
* 2.5 tsp. curry powder
* 1.5 tsp. garam masala
* 1.5 tsp. ground turmeric
* 1.5 tsp. ground cumin
* 0.75 tsp. ground coriander
* 1 tsp. salt
* Black pepper, to taste


* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 inch piece of fresh ginger
* 250g mushrooms
* Whatever other vegetables are in season: 
  * For example: 2 zucchini, 3 peppers, 3 carrots, a bunch of potatoes…
  * Other ideas: cauliflower, fennel, roasted squash, sweet potatoes, kale, 4 pak choi …


* 1.5 cup (270-300g) red lentils, or split red lentils (the split variety will cook a bit quicker)
* 400 g crushed tomatoes
* 400 mL full-fat coconut milk
* 3 tbsp unsweetened creamy almond butter, peanut butter, or tahini
* 1/2 a small lemon, juiced (we used lime)

For garnish: 
* 1/2 cup (~8g) fresh cilantro, roughly chopped

For serving: 
* Basmati or Jasmine rice
* (optional) Indian flatbread such as roti, paratha, or naan

###Steps:
1. Rinse the lentils in cold water until the water runs clear.
1. Heat a large, deep skillet or large saucepan over medium-high heat and add coconut oil or another kind of oil. Once the oil is shimmering, add the garlic and ginger and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent garlic from burning (or add them later with the vegetables).
1. Add and cook the vegetables.
1. Add the cumin, coriander, chili powder, curry powder, turmeric, garam masala, salt, and black pepper to taste, and cook for 30 to 60 seconds until fragrant, tossing frequently to prevent burning.
1. Add in the lentils and the crushed tomatoes and mix well. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan with a lid. Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked through and have mostly softened. If you find that the lentils are not quite soft after 25 minutes, add a few spoons more of water and cook for another 5 minutes.
1. Remove the lid and stir in the coconut milk, almond butter, along with salt and pepper to taste. Continue cooking on low heat, uncovered for 5 to 8 minutes, until the curry has thickened and is creamy.
1. Finally, stir in the lemon juice and cilantro, and turn off the heat. If you want your lentils to be even creamier and more on the puréed side, use an immersion blender to lightly purée the curry.
1. Serve the curry with rice and/or Indian flatbread and garnish with additional cilantro. 
1. Store leftovers in the fridge for 3-4 days.
