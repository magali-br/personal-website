        <p>
          I'm a software engineer, linguist, dancer, writer, and coach, passionate about experiencing wonder and making the world a better place. <br /> <br />
          As a generalist who never gets tired of jumping into new projects, I love to explore, discover, and connect ideas. I am a shapeshifter, travelling between worlds and balancing out the specialists who prefer to dive deep.
